2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net R_0_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): R_0_IBUF_inst/O, design_1_i/R_0
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch design_1_i/button_0/U0/sel_reg[0] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin design_1_i/button_0/U0/sel_reg[0]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch design_1_i/button_0/U0/sel_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin design_1_i/button_0/U0/sel_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch design_1_i/button_0/U0/sel_reg[2] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin design_1_i/button_0/U0/sel_reg[2]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 3 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
Related violations: <none>
